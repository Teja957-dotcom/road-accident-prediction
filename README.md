# 🚦 Road Accident Severity Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the **severity of road accidents** based on factors such as weather, time, road conditions, and other environmental features.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a classification model that can predict whether an accident is likely to be:
- Minor
- Serious
- Fatal

This system can help in **risk analysis**, **safety planning**, and **decision making** for traffic authorities.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
